# RescueWorks Backend

FastAPI based backend for the RescueWorks multi tenant rescue management platform.

This backend exposes JSON APIs for:

- Organizations and users
- Pets and applications
- Medical records and appointments
- Events and signups
- Tasks
- Expenses and categories
- Messaging
- Payments and coupons

See ../frontend for a React dashboard that consumes these APIs.
